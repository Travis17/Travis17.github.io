<!--explanation of what the company does-->

    <p>You might be wondering, "Who the heck are these 17hats guys anyway?" Point taken. Well, we're a group of good-hearted folks with families, working really hard on an idea that we're very excited about. And just like you, we're trying to build our business. We're committed to staying small so we can keep costs low, which benefits everybody. We have this crazy belief that there are other good-hearted people out there willing to help us get a fair shot against the big corporate players.</p>

    <p>We believe there is a huge market of self-employed people looking for a simpler way to handle all of their business needs. Existing “solutions” often overlook the needs of businesses of one, and have too much complexity (that is often aimed at larger businesses).</p>

    <p>So this is where the rubber meets the road, and we hope you'll join us in building something great.</p>
