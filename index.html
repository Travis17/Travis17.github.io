    <p>My name is Travis Knoll and I currently live in the San Francisco bay area, which I love. I am currently from the colorful state of Colorado and I often travel back to see friends and family.
    At current I am taking the Web Design & Development course here at Full Sail and I really enjoy the course and the broad spectreme of knowledge that the school has given me.
    I really enjoy learning everything about technology and it is mind blowing how fast it changes and the amount that we can continue to learn. My passion stems from creating in general and I love photography and writing.</p>
