    <img src="images/warby.png">

        <h3>Target Audience</h3>
        <p>The target audience of the Warby Parker design is to cater to a younger hip crowd. This being said they bring a more youthful feeling to an older crowd as well. This is implemented through their design techniques with taking an older design and redefining it with a carefree and happy attitude.  </p>
        <h3>Client goal</h3>
        <p>The client wants the user to make a purchase and be a return customer. This would lead to increase company revenue.</p>
        <h3>Critique</h3>
        <p>Overall the branding and simplistic design of the company offers a simple and easy/carefree feel to the site that can be inviting. At second glace the change in topography will not only cater to where the user will be led in the header but it also can resemble a wireframe to that of the brand. The wireframe for this particular relevance can resemble that of the frames that are about to be purchased.</p>

    <h3>Critique</h3>
    <p>I this this is a great call to action because it not only offers to find out more about the movie through the site, but it also allows for the user to to interact with the experience and essentially click on the call to action to want to find out more. It is an intriguing way to present this call to action. </p>

Furthermore both parties will benefit becaues of increase in revenue for the business and return customer base and the user gets to create a neat design.</p>
    <h3>Critique</h3>
    <p>The reason I like or would choose this type of feature is how they show us or market their product in this respect. It shows the product well to include the audience they are gearing toward.</p>

    <h3>Client goal</h3>
    <p>The overall goal like many contact forms is to solve a problem. I like how lyft filters these problems as you can see that ehy will ask the user a couple of questions to categorize where the problem should be taken to and then it the answer isn't met they can be directed toward the actual contact form.</p>
    <h3>Critique</h3>
    <p>I like this format or form because it filters the problems and it should be easier for the site to answer or get back to each user.</p>

    <p>The about section is what I was looking for as it shows who the company is and this shows the user that they're real and I think this is important and adds a personable feel for interaction. I also think it is important to include a small to the point bio of the site and organization as they have done. They also have underneath the employees photos their social links. </p>
